"# ZarinRoichi" 
Hi there 👋  

I am **Zarin Tasnim Roichi**, a Computer Science graduate with strong interests in **Machine Learning, NLP, and LLM-based systems**.  
I enjoy working on **applied ML projects**, where models are not only trained and evaluated but also **integrated into backend-driven applications**.

My academic and project work has mainly focused on **Bengali Natural Language Processing**, including fake review detection, fake news classification, and sentiment analysis using **transformer-based models**. I have hands-on experience with **dataset preparation, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and error analysis**, as well as deploying trained models through **Python-based backend APIs**.

In addition to ML/NLP, I have worked on **SQL-based web applications** and **IoT-based automation projects**, which helped me build a strong understanding of end-to-end system development — from data and models to deployment and user interaction.

Currently, I am looking for **entry-level / graduate / internship opportunities** where I can grow as an ML engineer or software developer while contributing to real-world AI-powered systems.
